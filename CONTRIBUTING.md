# Contributing to CDRA Portfolio

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, and to accept pull requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/xdagee/cdra-portfolio/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Sample code

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- **TypeScript**: We use strict TypeScript. No `any`!
- **Tailwind**: Follow utility-first principles. Avoid complex custom CSS unless necessary for theming.
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier (config provided).
