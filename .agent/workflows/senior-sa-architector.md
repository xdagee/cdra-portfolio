## Step 1: Architectural Context Definition
- Assume the role of a Senior Software Architect.
- Identify system purpose, business goals, and primary quality attributes.
- Document architectural scope, constraints, and assumptions explicitly.

## Step 2: System Decomposition & Structure
// turbo
- Identify major components, services, and modules.
- Evaluate layering, boundaries, and responsibility allocation.
- Assess alignment with the intended architectural style (e.g., monolith, microservices, event-driven).

## Step 3: Architectural Patterns & Principles
// turbo
- Identify applied architectural patterns and design principles.
- Evaluate consistency and correctness of pattern usage.
- Highlight deviations, trade-offs, and rationale where evident.

## Step 4: Scalability & Performance Design
- Evaluate scalability strategies (horizontal vs vertical).
- Review load handling, concurrency, caching, and data access patterns.
- Identify architectural bottlenecks and growth limitations.

## Step 5: Reliability & Resilience
- Assess fault tolerance, redundancy, and failure isolation.
- Review error handling, retries, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation.
- Evaluate recovery strategies and availability targets.

## Step 6: Security Architecture
- Evaluate authentication, authorization, and trust boundaries.
- Review data protection, secrets management, and attack surface.
- Identify architectural security risks and missing controls.

## Step 7: Data Architecture
- Review data models, storage technologies, and consistency strategies.
- Evaluate data ownership, lifecycle management, and integrity.
- Assess suitability for current and projected workloads.

## Step 8: Maintainability & Evolvability
// turbo
- Assess modularity, coupling, and cohesion.
- Evaluate ease of change, extension, and refactoring.
- Identify architectural technical debt and rigidity risks.

## Step 9: Operational Architecture
- Review deployment model, environments, and infrastructure assumptions.
- Evaluate observability: logging, metrics, and tracing.
- Assess operational readiness and supportability.

## Step 10: Technology Stack Evaluation
- Review framework, language, and platform choices.
- Assess maturity, ecosystem support, and long-term viability.
- Identify unnecessary complexity or vendor lock-in risks.

## Step 11: Scoring & Architectural Assessment
- Assign a numeric score from 0.0 to 1.0 for each evaluated area:
  - System Structure
  - Scalability & Performance
  - Reliability & Resilience
  - Security Architecture
  - Data Architecture
  - Maintainability & Evolvability
  - Operational Readiness
  - Technology Stack
- Provide concise, evidence-based justification for each score.
- Present results in a structured table.

## Step 12: Architectural Verdict
- Deliver a clear professional verdict on architectural readiness.
- State whether the architecture is fit for:
  - Current production use
  - Near-term scaling
  - Long-term evolution

## Step 13: Strategic Recommendations
- Provide prioritized, actionable architectural recommendations.
- Distinguish between:
  - Critical architectural blockers
  - Medium-risk concerns
  - Strategic improvement opportunities
- Focus on decisions with the highest leverage and long-term impact.
