description: Conducts a comprehensive senior backend engineer performance review and determines eligibility for a 1.0 rating.
---

## Step 1: Review Context Initialization

- Assume the role of a Senior Engineering Reviewer.
- Confirm scope: backend services, APIs, data layers, and integrations.
- Acknowledge depth of experience across modern and legacy backend frameworks, languages, and platforms.

## Step 2: Backend Architecture & System Design

// turbo: run_command "grep -r 'Controller' src/"

- Evaluate service architecture, boundaries, and responsibility allocation.
- Review API design, data flow, and integration patterns.
- Assess long-term scalability, resilience, and maintainability.
- Assign a rating between 0.0 and 1.0 with evidence-based justification.

## Step 3: Framework & Tech Stack Mastery

// turbo

- Evaluate depth and breadth of experience across backend frameworks and runtimes.
- Review ability to select appropriate technologies based on constraints and goals.
- Identify examples of successful migrations, refactors, or platform upgrades.
- Assign a rating between 0.0 and 1.0 with justification.

## Step 4: Data Architecture & Persistence

- Assess data modeling, storage choices, and consistency strategies.
- Review transaction management, schema evolution, and data lifecycle practices.
- Identify improvements to performance, reliability, or data integrity.
- Assign a rating between 0.0 and 1.0 with justification.

## Step 5: Performance, Scalability & Efficiency

// turbo

- Evaluate concurrency handling, throughput, and latency optimization.
- Review caching strategies, asynchronous processing, and resource utilization.
- Identify measurable performance or cost-efficiency improvements.
- Assign a rating between 0.0 and 1.0 with justification.

## Step 6: Security & Compliance Engineering

- Evaluate authentication, authorization, and secrets management.
- Review secure coding practices, dependency hygiene, and vulnerability mitigation.
- Assess compliance with organizational and regulatory standards.
- Assign a rating between 0.0 and 1.0 with justification.

## Step 7: Code Quality, Testing & Standards

// turbo: run_command "composer test" OR "npm test"

- Assess code readability, modularity, and adherence to best practices.
- Review unit, integration, and contract test coverage.
- Evaluate enforcement of development standards and CI quality gates.
- Assign a rating between 0.0 and 1.0 with justification.

## Step 8: Reliability, Observability & Operations

- Evaluate logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting practices.
- Review failure handling, graceful degradation, and recovery mechanisms.
- Identify improvements to system reliability and MTTR.
- Assign a rating between 0.0 and 1.0 with justification.

## Step 9: Cross-Team Collaboration & Technical Leadership

- Evaluate collaboration with frontend, platform, and product teams.
- Review leadership in setting backend standards and best practices.
- Identify examples of mentoring and unblocking other engineers.
- Assign a rating between 0.0 and 1.0 with justification.

## Step 10: Business Impact & Outcomes

- Identify measurable business outcomes tied to backend work.
- Review impact on reliability, performance, delivery speed, or cost.
- Assess alignment between backend decisions and business objectives.
- Assign a rating between 0.0 and 1.0 with justification.

## Step 11: Scoring Summary

- Present all category ratings in a structured table.
- Validate consistency between evidence and assigned scores.
- Highlight any systemic risks or dependencies.

## Step 12: Overall Performance Verdict

- Deliver a clear final performance rating.
- Explicitly state whether performance meets the criteria for a 1.0 score.
- Justify the verdict based on cumulative technical and business impact.

## Step 13: Forward-Looking Development Guidance

- Identify growth opportunities appropriate for a high-impact senior backend engineer.
- Focus on increasing architectural scope, platform ownership, or strategic influence.
- Clearly distinguish development opportunities from performance gaps.
